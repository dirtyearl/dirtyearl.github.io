description: The UAW wants a larger slice of a percieved pie

Obviously the [UAW](https://uaw.org/) exists to extract benefits for its members. The question is really at whose expense. Years ago, one of the smarter things that the major auto companies did was force workers to accept some of their compensation in the form of equity in the company. At least now they incur some of the cost of their demands as partial owners.

The UAW appears to perceive the world as one in which the profits that accrue to GM, Ford, and Stellantis are part of a giant pie that they can demand a larger slice of at the expense of some unnamed hegemonic entity. Unfortunately, a great proportion of the entity are those who own shares in funds that are part of other people's retirement assets.

Another way to look at what the UAW does is to think about what mix of labor and capital goes into the manufacturing of automobiles, or the decisions as to where those automobiles are going to be manufactured. As the UAW extracts the perceived rents that exist in the industry, they simply induce the decision-makers to transfer unprofitable production to non-union locations. They may induce manufacturers to change the mix of products they produce, i.e. build big trucks. Or they may induce manufacturers to cut production of vehicles that may have been profitable but for the demands of the UAW, i.e. dropping planned production of electric vehicles or the partnerships to product them.

We'll see how it shakes out eventually. I doubt it will be good for the consumer in the end.
