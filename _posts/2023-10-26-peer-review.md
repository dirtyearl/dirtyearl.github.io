description: A comment on peer review for legitimacy
---
Peer review is nonsense in a lot of cases. It's a hurdle for promotion and tenure for people at not-so-prestigious colleges and universities.

No one is going to publish a professional article unless it is in a peer-reviewed journal, unless it is such complete schlock that it has been rejected from everywhere else. That said, peer reviewers often make inane comments and suggestions. The referee reports are often poorly written with comments that may or may not have anything to do with what is written. I have had referee reports suggesting that I am not a native speaker from people who are obviously not native speakers or writers.

Some people choose not to publish in peer-reviewed outlets. Probably to avoid the hassle. Most of the great ideas of the past were not formally peer reviewed.

Peer review is overrated.
